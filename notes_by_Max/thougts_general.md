## general thoughts 

I want this dissertation fully made by hand, instead of AI gen. The reason why I got this idea was the influence by Dr.Qui. He said that his dissertation was XXX. And I am deaming one day I will have my dissertation printed and placed with a glass of campagne. 

But also I will consider the efficiency.

It just a form of respect my work and a practive of scientific writting. And creat something really meaningful for the conclusion of the years I spent doing my Master's.

My friend Hongquan He said he did it around 40 pages, and Dr.Gao is around 90 pages. How long will I been?

PhD holders should be judged by their merits and contributions; master’s degree holders should be valued for their diligent effort. Once a Prof said at the Dr.Qui's defence. As someone who aim to be a scienfic researcher, I would like to express my acknowlement and ambition in the dissertation.
